# D3 Exploration

To explore the capabilities of D3, I created a visualization of the effect of cryptocurrency on visual computing stocks (such as Nvidia). This project is for learning purposes only and is not meant to be used in drawing any citable conclusions.

The Bitcoin data is retrieved from the [CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API](https://www.coindesk.com/api/) and the NVDA Stock Information is retrieved from the [IEX API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/).

To run the project, clone this repository and run the following commands:

    cd d3-exploration
    npm install
    npm run dev
